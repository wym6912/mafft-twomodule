./staralign  -V "-"1.53 -b 62 -g 0 -f "-"1.53 -Q 100.0 -h 0 -S -T 4 -s 2 -i test/staralign-test1/data.fasta -c test/staralign-test1/center.fasta

Arguments:
Input:
-i FileName: common file with FASTA format
-c FileName: center file with FASTA format
Align mode:
-F: use FFT align (default)
-G: do not use FFT align, just make it simpler
-L: Use legacy gap cost in order to get less gaps
-e: use memsave mode for alignment
Alignment arugments:
-f p: ppenalty
-D, -P: -D the sequence is DNA, -P the sequence is Protein
-z threshold, -w Winsize: FFT align arguments: fftthreshold, fftWinSize
-B band: Kband in calcuating DP-matrix during the alignment. If not defined this varible, use auto double
Scoring matrix:
-b: BLOSUM Matrix
-j: use jtt/kimura model, pamN is needed
-m: use tm model, pamN is needed
Other arugments:
-q: Center sequence is not in the common file, need alignment on center file and common file
-S: Calcuate SP Scores after alignment
-d: Print Score Matrix fits the common file and exit
-T: Use T threads to run this program
-s: nmax shift factor, it means the times of the max length
-v: show program version
-H, -?: Print this help message and exit
