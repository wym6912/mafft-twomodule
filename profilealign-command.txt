./profilealign -p test/profilealign-test1/sample/mt1x_cd-hit.fasta -i test/profilealign-test1/sample/mt1x_cd-hit.list.txt

Arguments:
Input:
-i: sequences file name, every line has a file name without spaces
-p: center file with FASTA format
Align mode:
-F: use FFT align (default)
-G: do not use FFT align, just make it simpler
-A: Use gap open and extension mode to align sequences
-N: Use simple align mode to align sequences
-L: Use legacy gap cost in order to get less gaps
-e: use memsave mode for alignment
Alignment arugments:
-f p, -g pex: ppenalty, ppenalty_ex (only used in -A)
-D, -P: -D the sequence is DNA, -P the sequence is Protein
-z threshold, -w Winsize: FFT align arguments: fftthreshold, fftWinSize
-B band: Kband in calcuating DP-matrix during the alignment
Scoring matrix:
-b pamN: BLOSUM[pamN] Matrix
-j pamN: use jtt/kimura model, pamN is needed
-m pamN: use tm model, pamN is needed
Guide tree construction:
-W: tuplesize on UPGMA (6 or 10, 10 is only for DNA/RNA sequences)
-X sub: Use mix method to calcuate the UPGMA cluster, the sub effect is needed, it must be in (0, 1)
-E: Use average method to calcuate the UPGMA cluster
-q: Use minimum method to calcuate the UPGMA cluster
Other arugments:
-S: Calcuate SP Scores after alignment
-d: Print Score Matrix fits the file1 and exit
-T: use T threads to run this program
-v: show program version and exit
-H, -?: Print help message and exit
